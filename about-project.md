# About My Project

Student Name:  Jack Venerus
Student Email:  jgveneru@syr.edu

### What it does
My program scrapes aircraft listings from ASO.com, an aircraft sales listing site. It scrapes the aircraft make, model, year, registration,Serial Number, Price, aircraft usage time, Landings, where it's located (state), the company that's listing it, and the URL for the listing. The program then uses that data to map how many and which aircraft are for sale in each state. The user can select a state to see all of the aircraft for sale there.
